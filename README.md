# Flesh and Blood Life Tracker

Simple React PWA for tracking Flesh and Blood life totals.

- Small and snappy. Or at least as much as a web app will get me.
- Configurable player counts (up to 4).
- Text readable by opponents.
- Life history tracking.
- Mostly no-frills.
- Uses the official FaB card database, so will always be up to date.
- Works offline (Install it via your browsers "Install" or "Add app to home screen" button).
